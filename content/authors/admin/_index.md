I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Marketing at Cornell University. My research is centered on consumer judgments and decisions in real-world settings, especially within the digital environment. My dissertation delves into the impact of numerical judgments in areas like ratings, time perception, and emerging technologies such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Before stepping into academia, I was a founding member of OYO Rooms, an e-commerce startup that has since expanded into a top global hospitality chain. I also worked as an Intellectual Property Law Consultant for US law firms.

I will join the Marketing & Behavioural Science Division as an Assistant Professor at The University of British Columbia in 2024.
