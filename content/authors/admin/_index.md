I am an Assistant Professor in the Marketing & Behavioural Science Division at The University of British Columbia. My research examines how consumers form judgments and make decisions in real-world contexts, with a particular focus on numerical cognitionâ€”including how people interpret ratings and perceive time. My work has been published in the Journal of Marketing Research.

Before pursuing an academic career, I was a founding team member of OYO Rooms, an e-commerce startup that has grown into a leading global hospitality chain. I also served as an Intellectual Property Law Consultant for U.S. law firms, advising on various aspects of technology and consumer-focused innovations.
